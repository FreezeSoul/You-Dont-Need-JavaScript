# CSS Typing Animation

A **pure HTML + CSS** typing effect that simulates text being typed on a screen.

## ✨ Features
- No JavaScript used
- Smooth "typing" effect with a blinking cursor
- Fully responsive and minimal

## 🧠 How It Works
Uses CSS keyframes with `steps()` to reveal characters one by one,  
and a separate `blink` animation for the cursor effect.
